# Smart-Fire-Detection-System-for-Agriculture ðŸ”¥ðŸŒ¾

The **Smart Fire Detection System for Agriculture** is an AI- and IoT-based solution designed to detect potential fire outbreaks in agricultural fields in real-time. It uses sensors to collect environmental data and a machine learning model to predict fire risk. Alerts and actions such as automatic sprinkler activation are handled via microcontrollers and wireless communication modules.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Real-Time Fire Risk Detection**: Uses sensor data (temperature, smoke, flame) to detect early signs of fire.
- **AI-Driven Prediction**: A trained ML model classifies input conditions as fire/no fire based on patterns.
- **Automated Response**: Activates sprinkler system instantly upon fire detection.
- **Live Alert System**: Sends SMS alerts using the A9G GSM module to notify the farmer.
- **Web-Based Dashboard**: Displays live sensor data and system status using a user-friendly interface.
- **Low-Cost Deployment**: Built using open-source tools and cost-effective hardware.
